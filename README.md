Vitawellnessub – SDG Projects Visual Blueprint (Step‑by‑Step)

This blueprint lays out three compact projects aligned to SDG 4, SDG 3, and SDG 2. Each includes:

Scope & users

Architecture (frontend, backend, DB)

Step‑by‑step build plan (sprint style)

Minimal schemas, API routes, and UI snippets you can paste into Canva mockups or your codebase

leveraging Supabase, Cursor AI, Bolt.new, Rork.app, Claude, MGX in my workflow


-- SDG 4 — Quality Education: LearnWell (micro‑courses + quizzes + certificates)
1) Goal & Users

Goal: Deliver bite‑sized learning modules (wellness, nutrition, life skills) with quizzes & certificates.

Users: Students, community learners, coaches.

2) Architecture

Frontend: HTML/CSS, vanilla JS (progress UI)

Backend (Core): Python FastAPI (REST)

DB: MySQL (courses, lessons, quizzes, progress, certs)

Java component: Spring Boot microservice for recommendations & certificate PDFs (or Android companion for offline access)

Optional: Supabase for Auth (JWT) + Storage (assets/media), mapping Supabase user id → MySQL profile row.

-- SDG 3 — Good Health & Well‑being: HealthTrack (personal metrics + charts) --
1) Goal & Users

Goal: Let users log mood, steps, hydration, sleep; visualize trends.

Users: General public, students, athletes.

2) Architecture

Frontend: HTML5/CSS/JS + Chart.js for visuals

Backend: Python FastAPI, MySQL

Auth/Storage (optional): Supabase for auth & image/file storage

3) Database (MySQL)

SDG 2 — Zero Hunger: NutriAccess (nutrition tips + simple meal planner)
1) Goal & Users

Goal: Educate users on balanced diets; provide simple planner and local tips.

Users: Families, students, community health workers.

2) Architecture

Frontend: HTML5/CSS/JS

Backend: Python FastAPI, MySQL

Optional: Supabase Storage for images (food icons, PDFs)

3) Database (MySQL)


Cursor AI → Refactor and implement features fast inside the editor.

Bolt.new → One‑prompt scaffolding for web apps; iterate and deploy previews.

Rork.app → Rapid mobile prototyping (React Native) if you want Android/iOS companions.

Claude / MGX → Brainstorming flows, drafting docs, generating component stubs and test cases.
